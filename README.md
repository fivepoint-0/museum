# Tour of Go Learnbook

This repository is now meant to be a reflection of the Tour of Go book available at [A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour)

You can fork the `main` branch if you want to use the Tour of Go Learnbook as a blank slate. 

The main sections of the `Tour of Go` are reflected in the subfolder `ToG (Tour of Go)/` in the root of this repository. Those sections are:
```sh
basics/
concurrency/
flowcontrol/
generics/
methods/
moretypes/
welcome/
```

Each of the subsection folders within the main section folders each have their corresponding `<subsection_name>.md`

# Tour of Go Learnbook

This repository is now meant to be a reflection of the Tour of Go book available at [A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour)

You can fork the `main` branch if you want to use the Tour of Go Learnbook as a blank slate. 

The main sections of the `Tour of Go` are reflected in the subfolder `tour_of_go/` in the root of this repository. Those sections are, in order:


1. `welcome/`
2. `basics/`
3. `flowcontrol/`
4. `moretypes/`
5. `methods/`
6. `generics/`
7. `concurrency/`


Each of the subsection folders within the main section folders each have their corresponding `README.md`

Not every `README.md` has the required knowledge to make an example in the `main.go` file next to the `README.md`. This is on purpose, partly because I'm lazy, and partly because researching the usage and topics around one of the subjects in the subfolders is part of every programming journey... Alright, I'm mostly lazy.


### Luke's preferences/opinions on learning Golang through the Tour of Go:

---

1. I try as much as I can to make something inside of the codebase without looking up information.

2. I look online to compare my examples with examples from others, to see what I think I did well and what I think I could improve on.

3. There are multiple ways to solve problems, and finding the balance between ease-of-use and efficiency is different for every programmer, and, even for one programmer, different between programming problems.

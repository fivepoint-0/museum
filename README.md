# Tour of Go Learnbook

This repository is now meant to be a reflection of the Tour of Go book available at [A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour)

You can fork the `main` branch if you want to use the Tour of Go Learnbook as a blank slate. 

The main sections of the `Tour of Go` are reflected in the subfolder `ToG (Tour of Go)/` in the root of this repository. Those sections are, in order:


1. `welcome/`
2. `basics/`
3. `flowcontrol/`
4. `moretypes/`
5. `methods/`
6. `generics/`
7. `concurrency/`


Each of the subsection folders within the main section folders each have their corresponding `README.md`
